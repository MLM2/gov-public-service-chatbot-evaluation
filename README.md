# gov-public-service-chatbot-evaluation
Evaluation of generative AI chatbot responses to public service queries using Microsoft Azure AI Foundry — applying AI quality, NLP, and risk/safety metrics for responsible AI oversight.
This project evaluates the responses of a government public service chatbot, simulating an AI system that assists citizens with questions about immigration, veterans’ benefits, driver’s licenses, and passports.

The evaluation applies Microsoft Azure AI Foundry’s built-in evaluation framework, using both AI quality metrics and risk & safety metrics to assess the chatbot’s outputs.

The project demonstrates practical skills in:

Responsible AI evaluation

Application of Microsoft AI evaluation tooling

Alignment with NIST AI Risk Management Framework principles

AI governance practices relevant to national security and public-sector use of generative AI
